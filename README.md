# Zebra Puzzles
This is a project to create and solve zebra puzzles / Einstein puzzles.

## Work to be done
1. Replicate [Raymond Hettinger's code](https://rhettinger.github.io/einstein.html#einstein-puzzle) to solve the Einstein puzzle
1. Use it to solve another same-sized puzzle
1. Use it to solve another bigger puzzle
1. Create nice-looking puzzle representation and solver interface
1. Extend it to generate a new puzzle
1. Use a different solver like [cryptominisat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat)
